##P1 - Popular Movies App, Stage 1 Rubric
###The Rubric
####Required Components
`To “meet specifications”, your app must fulfill all the criteria listed in this section of the rubric.`

  - Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails
  - UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated
  - UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie
  - Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
  - When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.
  - When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched

-**Network API Implementation** 

  - In a background thread, app queries the /discover/movies API with the query parameter for the sort criteria specified in the           settings menu. (Note: Each sorting criteria is a different API call.)
  - This query can also be used to fetch the related metadata needed for the detail view.
